# 3D-UNet
3D UNet model to automatically segment organs from CT images

Code to train 3D UNet model which automatically segments prostate, bladder and rectum from CT and sCT (generated using https://github.com/keyurs19/CycleGAN-2D) images.

The model was trained using the Pelvic Reference Data (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Pelvic-Reference-Data) and a private dataset.
